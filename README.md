The used data comes from an *MMA7660FC* accelerometer which was connected with *Arduino Nano v3* microcontroller. The visualisation has a form of an arcade game, where the player can control a spaceship using a gamepad which reacts to gestures. The main goal of the game is to avoid or destroy approaching meteorites. Additionaly the application shows diagrams of received data.
